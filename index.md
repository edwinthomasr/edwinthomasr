     What an exciting week it has been. I have been learning a lot about git and github. 
I have been doing zoom meetings every night from 5:30 pm to about 6 or so. Git is more confusing than I thought it would be, but that's ok, it's all part of the learning process. I can't wait to move on to Javascript and Python. Programming in these languages is so much fun!
